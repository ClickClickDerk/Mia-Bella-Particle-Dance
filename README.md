# Mia Bella Particle Dance

Mia Bella Particle Dance is a Three.js-based visual animation that simulates particles orbiting in a 3D space, creating a beautiful and dynamic particle motion visualizer. The particles' motion is driven by the Three.js Clock and can be customized for various visual effects. 

## Features

- 3D particle motion using Three.js.
- Customizable particle geometry and motion paths.
- Responsive design with automatic adjustment for different screen sizes.
- Ambient and directional lighting for enhanced visual aesthetics.
- Grid helper to assist in scene positioning.
- Real-time interaction with OrbitControls for navigating the scene.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- Basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and Three.js.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClickClickDerk/Mia-Bella-Particle-Dance.git

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.

3. Explore the scene by clicking and dragging to move the camera, zoom in/out, or view particles in motion.

Code Structure
index.html: Main file that sets up the scene, camera, renderer, controls, and particles.
JavaScript handles particle movement using THREE.Clock, with custom particle positions updated based on time.
How it Works
Particles in the scene orbit a central point, and their positions are calculated using trigonometric functions. The speed and direction of each particle are influenced by a unique speed factor to create a natural flow in the particle dance.

Customization
You can customize the particles by modifying the following properties:

particleCount: Number of particles in the scene.
particleGeometry: Shape and size of each particle.
color: Change the material color for a unique visual effect.
